*********************HOW TO START THIS GAME***********************
*                                                       	 *  
*  1) place this folder "game_with_shell" in your home directory *

*  3) just type ./game.sh                                        *
******************************************************************

Just start the game and follow the instructions.To play this game you have to open atleast two terminals. Once you are done with the instruction just press 'y' in the main terminal in which the game.sh is running.Then you will get the instruction for the next Level.(complete the levels by executing the commands from the terminal)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>HOW THE GAME WORKS>>>>>>>
           game.sh is the main shell script in that the other shell scripts will get executed.For each level I have given two files verify* and instr*, verify file is used to check whether you have completed the instruction which is given and instr* file is use to give the instructions for each level.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ HOW CAN I DEVELOPE(CONTRIBUTE TO) THIS GAME++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
         From this game we learn about some commands & skills to use open source softwares(UNIX) and also we can share our skills with others.If you want to share any skills(related to the commands and shells) with others then just write two shell scripts, one for instruction that is what the player has to do and another one is for verification for that instruction.Add both the scripts in the game_with_shell folder by changing the permission to 777 0r 555(By giving execution permission to that files). 

          We can make use of the commands which normally get executed in all GNU/Linux's distributions and add them as a level.Make this game helpful to those guys who are new to the world of open source and free software. So start adding the Levels.
